# Library applications

These applications use scenario-based execution tests instead of the top-level
sample runner's fixed argument and text-output fixture.

| Application | Execution evidence | Commands and contracts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `path_join.lani` | `tests/path_execution.rs`, x86_64 Linux; raw-byte/NUL output, options, allocation and write failures | [Byte paths and owned buffers](../../docs/stdlib-paths.md#application) |

Compile path-join with both `--stdlib-root stdlib` and `--source-root extended`.
The library implementations are Lanius; the Rust test harness supplies inputs and
checks the resulting native executable.
